XXX  4.2. Variable Assignment
#############################


 =
    the assignment operator ( *no space before and after* )



    |Caution|

    Do not confuse this with `= <comparison-ops.html#EQUALSIGNREF>`__
    and `-eq <comparison-ops.html#EQUALREF>`__ , which
    `test <tests.html#IFTHEN>`__ , rather than assign!

    Note that = can be either an *assignment* or a *test* operator,
    depending on context.





    **Example 4-2. Plain Variable Assignment**


    .. code-block:: sh

        #!/bin/bash
        # Naked variables

        echo

        # When is a variable "naked", i.e., lacking the '$' in front?
        # When it is being assigned, rather than referenced.

        # Assignment
        a=879
        echo "The value of \"a\" is $a."

        # Assignment using 'let'
        let a=16+5
        echo "The value of \"a\" is now $a."

        echo

        # In a 'for' loop (really, a type of disguised assignment):
        echo -n "Values of \"a\" in the loop are: "
        for a in 7 8 9 11
        do
          echo -n "$a "
        done

        echo
        echo

        # In a 'read' statement (also a type of assignment):
        echo -n "Enter \"a\" "
        read a
        echo "The value of \"a\" is now $a."

        echo

        exit 0





    **Example 4-3. Variable Assignment, plain and fancy**


    .. code-block:: sh

        #!/bin/bash

        a=23              # Simple case
        echo $a
        b=$a
        echo $b

        # Now, getting a little bit fancier (command substitution).

        a=`echo Hello!`   # Assigns result of 'echo' command to 'a' ...
        echo $a
        #  Note that including an exclamation mark (!) within a
        #+ command substitution construct will not work from the command-line,
        #+ since this triggers the Bash "history mechanism."
        #  Inside a script, however, the history functions are disabled by default.

        a=`ls -l`         # Assigns result of 'ls -l' command to 'a'
        echo $a           # Unquoted, however, it removes tabs and newlines.
        echo
        echo "$a"         # The quoted variable preserves whitespace.
                          # (See the chapter on "Quoting.")

        exit 0




    Variable assignment using the *$(...)* mechanism (a newer method
    than `backquotes <commandsub.html#BACKQUOTESREF>`__ ). This is
    likewise a form of `command
    substitution <commandsub.html#COMMANDSUBREF>`__ .


    .. code-block:: sh

        # From /etc/rc.d/rc.local
        R=$(cat /etc/redhat-release)
        arch=$(uname -m)
