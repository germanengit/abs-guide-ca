How did I come to write a scripting book? It's a strange tale. It seems
that a few years back I needed to learn shell scripting -- and what
better way to do that than to read a good book on the subject? I was
looking to buy a tutorial and reference covering all aspects of the
subject. I was looking for a book that would take difficult concepts,
turn them inside out, and explain them in excruciating detail, with
well-commented examples. `[1] <authorsnote.html#FTN.AEN21281>`__ In
fact, I was looking for *this very book*, or something very much like
it. Unfortunately, `it didn't exist <biblio.html#KOCHANREF>`__, and if I
wanted it, I'd have to write it. And so, here we are, folks.

That reminds me of the apocryphal story about a mad professor. Crazy as
a loon, the fellow was. At the sight of a book, any book -- at the
library, at a bookstore, anywhere -- he would become totally obsessed
with the idea that he could have written it, should have written it --
and done a better job of it to boot. He would thereupon rush home and
proceed to do just that, write a book with the very same title. When he
died some years later, he allegedly had several thousand books to his
credit, probably putting even Asimov to shame. The books might not have
been any good, who knows, but does that really matter? Here's a fellow
who lived his dream, even if he was obsessed by it, driven by it . . .
and somehow I can't help admiring the old coot.
