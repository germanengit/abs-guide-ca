"How did I come to write a scripting book? It's a strange tale. It seems that"
" a few years back I needed to learn shell scripting -- and what better way "
"to do that than to read a good book on the subject? I was looking to buy a "
"tutorial and reference covering all aspects of the subject. I was looking "
"for a book that would take difficult concepts, turn them inside out, and "
"explain them in excruciating detail, with well-commented examples. `[1] "
"<authorsnote.html#FTN.AEN21281>`__ In fact, I was looking for *this very "
"book*, or something very much like it. Unfortunately, `it didn't exist "
"<biblio.html#KOCHANREF>`__, and if I wanted it, I'd have to write it. And "
"so, here we are, folks."

"That reminds me of the apocryphal story about a mad professor. Crazy as a "
"loon, the fellow was. At the sight of a book, any book -- at the library, at"
" a bookstore, anywhere -- he would become totally obsessed with the idea "
"that he could have written it, should have written it -- and done a better "
"job of it to boot. He would thereupon rush home and proceed to do just that,"
" write a book with the very same title. When he died some years later, he "
"allegedly had several thousand books to his credit, probably putting even "
"Asimov to shame. The books might not have been any good, who knows, but does"
" that really matter? Here's a fellow who lived his dream, even if he was "
"obsessed by it, driven by it . . . and somehow I can't help admiring the old"
" coot."
