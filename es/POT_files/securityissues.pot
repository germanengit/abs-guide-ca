msgid "A brief warning about script security is indicated. A shell script may contain a *worm* , *trojan* , or even a *virus* . For that reason, never run as *root* a script (or permit it to be inserted into the system startup scripts in ``       /etc/rc.d      `` ) unless you have obtained said script from a trusted source or you have carefully analyzed it to make certain it does nothing harmful."

Still, this could be a useful method of keeping scripts secure from all but the most skilled hackers."
