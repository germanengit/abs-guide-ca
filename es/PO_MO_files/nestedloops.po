"A *nested loop* is a loop within a loop, an inner loop within the body of an"
" outer one. How this works is that the first pass of the outer loop triggers"
" the inner loop, which executes to completion. Then the second pass of the "
"outer loop triggers the inner loop again. This repeats until the outer loop "
"finishes. Of course, a *break* within either the inner or outer loop would "
"interrupt this process."
