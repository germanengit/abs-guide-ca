#. System administrators often write scripts to automate common tasks.
   Give several instances where such scripts would be useful.

#. Write a script that upon invocation shows the `time and
   date <timedate.html#DATEREF>`__ , `lists all logged-in
   users <system.html#WHOREF>`__ , and gives the system
   `uptime <system.html#UPTIMEREF>`__ . The script then `saves this
   information <io-redirection.html#IOREDIRREF>`__ to a logfile.
