"A command expects the first three `file descriptors <io-"

"reassigning one of the file descriptors to another file (or a pipe, or "
"anything permissible). File descriptors may be reassigned locally (for a "
"command, a command group, a `subshell <subshells.html#SUBSHELLSREF>`__ , a "
"`while or if or case or for loop <redircb.html#REDIRREF>`__ ...), or "
"globally, for the remainder of the shell (using `exec "
