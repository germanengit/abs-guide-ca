A Public Domain license essentially does not restrict ANY legitimate
distribution or use of this book. The author especially encourages its
(royalty-free!) use for classroom and instructional purposes.

To date, limited print rights (Lulu edition) have been granted to one
individual and to *no one else*. Neither that individual nor Lulu holds
or ever has held a valid copyright.

| |Warning|                            |
| It has come to the attention of the  |
| author that *unauthorized*           |
| electronic and print editions of     |
| this book are being sold             |
| commercially on itunes®,             |
| *amazon.com* and elsewhere. These    |
| are illegal and pirated editions     |
| produced without the author's        |
| permission, and readers of this book |
| are strongly urged not to purchase   |
| them. In fact, these pirated         |
| editions are now legal, but          |
| necessarily fall into the Public     |
| Domain, and any copyright notices    |
| contained within them are invalid    |
| and void.                            |
