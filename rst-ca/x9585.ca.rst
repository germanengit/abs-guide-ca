15.1. Job Control Commands
==========================

Certain of the following job control commands take a *job identifier* as
an argument. See the `table <x9585.html#JOBIDTABLE>`_ at end of the
chapter.

**jobs**
    Lists the jobs running in the background, giving the *job number*.
    Not as useful as `ps <system.html#PPSSREF>`_.

       :alt: Note

       Note
    It is all too easy to confuse *jobs* and *processes*. Certain
    `builtins <internal.html#BUILTINREF>`_, such as **kill**,
    **disown**, and **wait** accept either a job number or a process
    number as an argument. The `fg <x9585.html#FGREF>`_,
    `bg <x9585.html#BGREF>`_ and **jobs** commands accept only a job
    number.

    ::

        bash$ sleep 100 &
        [1] 1384

        bash $ jobs
        [1]+  Running                 sleep 100 &

    "1" is the job number (jobs are maintained by the current shell).
    "1384" is the `PID <internalvariables.html#PPIDREF>`_ or *process ID
    number* (processes are maintained by the system). To kill this
    job/process, either a **kill %1** or a **kill 1384** works.

    *Thanks, S.C.*

**disown**
    Remove job(s) from the shell's table of active jobs.

**fg**, **bg**
    The **fg** command switches a job running in the background into the
    foreground. The **bg** command restarts a suspended job, and runs it
    in the background. If no job number is specified, then the **fg** or
    **bg** command acts upon the currently running job.

**wait**
    Suspend script execution until all jobs running in background have
    terminated, or until the job number or process ID specified as an
    option terminates. Returns the `exit
    status <exit-status.html#EXITSTATUSREF>`_ of waited-for command.

    You may use the **wait** command to prevent a script from exiting
    before a background job finishes executing (this would create a
    dreaded `orphan process <x9585.html#ZOMBIEREF>`_).

    **Example 15-26. Waiting for a process to finish before proceeding**

    ::

        #!/bin/bash

        ROOT_UID=0   # Only users with $UID 0 have root privileges.
        E_NOTROOT=65
        E_NOPARAMS=66

        if [ "$UID" -ne "$ROOT_UID" ]
        then
          echo "Must be root to run this script."
          # "Run along kid, it's past your bedtime."
          exit $E_NOTROOT
        fi  

        if [ -z "$1" ]
        then
          echo "Usage: `basename $0` find-string"
          exit $E_NOPARAMS
        fi


        echo "Updating 'locate' database..."
        echo "This may take a while."
        updatedb /usr &     # Must be run as root.

        wait
        # Don't run the rest of the script until 'updatedb' finished.
        # You want the the database updated before looking up the file name.

        locate $1

        #  Without the 'wait' command, in the worse case scenario,
        #+ the script would exit while 'updatedb' was still running,
        #+ leaving it as an orphan process.

        exit 0

    Optionally, **wait** can take a *job identifier* as an argument, for
    example, ``wait%1`` or ``wait                 $PPID``.

    table <x9585.html#JOBIDTABLE>`_.

       Tip
    Within a script, running a command in the background with an
    ampersand (&) may cause the script to hang until **ENTER** is hit.
    This seems to occur with commands that write to ``stdout``. It can
    be a major annoyance.

    ::

        #!/bin/bash
        # test.sh         

        ls -l &
        echo "Done."

    ::

        bash$ ./test.sh
        Done.
         [bozo@localhost test-scripts]$ total 1
         -rwxr-xr-x    1 bozo     bozo           34 Oct 11 15:09 test.sh
         _
                       

        As Walter Brameld IV explains it:
         As far as I can tell, such scripts don't actually hang. It just
         seems that they do because the background command writes text
        to
         the console after the prompt. The user gets the impression that
         the prompt was never displayed. Here's the sequence of events:
         1. Script launches background command.
         2. Script exits.
         3. Shell displays the prompt.
         4. Background command continues running and writing text to the
         console.
         5. Background command finishes.
         6. User doesn't see a prompt at the bottom of the output,
        thinks script
         is hanging.

    Placing a **wait** after the background command seems to remedy
    this.

    ::

        #!/bin/bash
        # test.sh         

        ls -l &
        echo "Done."
        wait

    ::

        bash$ ./test.sh
        Done.
         [bozo@localhost test-scripts]$ total 1
         -rwxr-xr-x    1 bozo     bozo           34 Oct 11 15:09 test.sh
                       

    `Redirecting <io-redirection.html#IOREDIRREF>`_ the output of the
    command to a file or even to ``/dev/null`` also takes care of this
    problem.

**suspend**
    This has a similar effect to **Control**-**Z**, but it suspends the
    shell (the shell's parent process should resume it at an appropriate
    time).

**logout**
    Exit a login shell, optionally specifying an `exit
    status <exit-status.html#EXITSTATUSREF>`_.

**times**
    Gives statistics on the system time elapsed when executing commands,
    in the following form:

    ::

        0m0.020s 0m0.020s

    This capability is of relatively limited value, since it is not
    common to profile and benchmark shell scripts.

**kill**
    Forcibly terminate a process by sending it an appropriate
    *terminate* signal (see `Example 17-6 <system.html#KILLPROCESS>`_).

    **Example 15-27. A script that kills itself**

    ::

        #!/bin/bash
        # self-destruct.sh

        kill $$  # Script kills its own process here.
                 # Recall that "$$" is the script's PID.

        echo "This line will not echo."
        # Instead, the shell sends a "Terminated" message to stdout.

        exit 0   # Normal exit? No!

        #  After this script terminates prematurely,
        #+ what exit status does it return?
        #
        # sh self-destruct.sh
        # echo $?
        # 143
        #
        # 143 = 128 + 15
        #             TERM signal

       Note
    ``kill -l`` lists all the `signals <debugging.html#SIGNALD>`_ (as
    does the file ``/usr/include/asm/signal.h``). A ``kill -9`` is a
    *sure kill*, which will usually terminate a process that stubbornly
    refuses to die with a plain **kill**. Sometimes, a
    ``kill         -15`` works. A *zombie* process, that is, a child
    process that has terminated, but that the `parent
    process <internal.html#FORKREF>`_ has not (yet) killed, cannot be
    killed by a logged-on user -- you can't kill something that is
    already dead -- but **init** will generally clean it up sooner or
    later.

**killall**
    The **killall** command kills a running process by *name*, rather
    than by `process ID <special-chars.html#PROCESSIDREF>`_. If there
    are multiple instances of a particular command running, then doing a
    *killall* on that command will terminate them *all*.

    .. figure:: http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/images/note.gif
       :align: center
       :alt: Note

       Note
    This refers to the **killall** command in ``/usr/bin``, *not* the
    `killall script <sysscripts.html#KILLALL2REF>`_ in
    ``/etc/rc.d/init.d``.

**command**
    The **command** directive disables aliases and functions for the
    command immediately following it.

    ::

        bash$ command ls
                      

    .. figure:: http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/images/note.gif
       :align: center
       :alt: Note

       Note
    This is one of three shell directives that effect script command
    processing. The others are `builtin <x9585.html#BLTREF>`_ and
    `enable <x9585.html#ENABLEREF>`_.

**builtin**
    Invoking **builtin BUILTIN\_COMMAND** runs the command
    ``BUILTIN_COMMAND`` as a shell
    `builtin <internal.html#BUILTINREF>`_, temporarily disabling both
    functions and external system commands with the same name.

**enable**
    This either enables or disables a shell builtin command. As an
    example, ``enable -n           kill`` disables the shell builtin
    `kill <x9585.html#KILLREF>`_, so that when Bash subsequently
    encounters *kill*, it invokes the external command ``/bin/kill``.

    The ``-a`` option to *enable* lists all the shell builtins,
    indicating whether or not they are enabled. The ``-f filename``
    option lets *enable* load a `builtin <internal.html#BUILTINREF>`_ as
    a shared library (DLL) module from a properly compiled object file.
    `[2] <x9585.html#FTN.AEN9869>`_.

**autoload**
    This is a port to Bash of the *ksh* autoloader. With **autoload** in
    place, a function with an *autoload* declaration will load from an
    external file at its first invocation.
    `[3] <x9585.html#FTN.AEN9890>`_ This saves system resources.

    Note that *autoload* is not a part of the core Bash installation. It
    needs to be loaded in with ``enable -f`` (see above).

`[1] <x9585.html#AEN9694>`_

This only applies to *child processes*, of course.

`[2] <x9585.html#AEN9869>`_

The C source for a number of loadable builtins is typically found in the
``/usr/share/doc/bash-?.??/functions`` directory.

Note that the ``-f`` option to **enable** is not
`portable <portabilityissues.html>`_ to all systems.

`[3] <x9585.html#AEN9890>`_

The same effect as **autoload** can be achieved with `typeset
-fu <declareref.html>`_.
