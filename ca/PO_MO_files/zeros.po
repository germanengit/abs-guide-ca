"Like ``         /dev/null        `` , ``         /dev/zero        `` is a "
"pseudo-device file, but it actually produces a stream of nulls ( *binary* "
"zeros, not the `ASCII <special-chars.html#ASCIIDEF>`__ kind). Output written"
" to ``         /dev/zero        `` disappears, and it is fairly difficult to"
" actually read the nulls emitted there, though it can be done with `od "
"<extmisc.html#ODREF>`__ or a hex editor. The chief use of ``         "
"/dev/zero        `` is creating an initialized dummy file of predetermined "
"length intended as a temporary swap file."
