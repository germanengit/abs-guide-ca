msgid "This book is somewhat of a departure from his other major work, `HOW-2 Meet Women: The Shy Man's Guide to Relationships <http://bash.deta.in/hmw60.zip>`__. He has also written the `Software-Building HOWTO <http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Building-HOWTO.html>`__. Of late, he has been trying his (heavy) hand at fiction: `Dave Dawson Over Berlin (First Installment) <http://bash.deta.in/dave-dawson-over-berlin.epub>`__ `Dave Dawson Over Berlin (Second Installment) <http://bash.deta.in/dave-dawson-over-berlin.II.epub>`__ and `Dave Dawson Over Berlin (Third Installment) <http://bash.deta.in/dave-dawson-over-berlin.III.epub>`__ . He also has a few *Instructables* (`here <http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Morse-Code-Shield/>`__, `here <http://www.instructables.com/id/Haywired-Hackduino/>`__, `here <http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-DIY-SD-Card-Logging-Shield/>`__, `here <http://www.instructables.com/id/Binguino-An-Arduino-based-Bingo-Number-Generato/>`__, `here <http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Raspberry-Pi-Lapdock-Connection/>`__, `here <http://www.instructables.com/id/The-Raspberry-Pi-Arduino-Connection/>`__, and `here <http://www.instructables.com/id/Switchable-Dual-Voltage-33v5v-Hacduino/>`__ to his (dis)credit."

msgid "A Linux user since 1995 (Slackware 2.2, kernel 1.2.1), the author has emitted a few software truffles, including the `cruft <http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/file/cruft-0.2.tar.gz>`__ one-time pad encryption utility, the `mcalc <http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/apps/financial/mcalc-1.6.tar.gz>`__ mortgage calculator, the `judge <http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/games/amusements/judge-1.0.tar.gz>`__ Scrabble® adjudicator, the `yawl <http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/libs/yawl-0.3.2.tar.gz>`__ word gaming list package, and the `Quacky <http://bash.deta.in/qky.README.html>`__ anagramming gaming package. He got off to a rather shaky start in the computer game -- programming FORTRAN IV on a CDC 3800 (on paper coding pads, with occasional forays on a keypunch machine and a Friden Flexowriter) -- and is not the least bit nostalgic for those days."
