"Quoting means just that, bracketing a string in quotes. This has the effect "
"of protecting `special characters <special-chars.html#SCHARLIST1>`__ in the "
"string from reinterpretation or expansion by the shell or shell script. (A "
"character is \"special\" if it has an interpretation other than its literal "
"meaning. For example, the `asterisk \\* <special-chars.html#ASTERISKREF>`__ "
"represents a *wild card* character in `globbing <globbingref.html>`__ and "
"`Regular Expressions <regexp.html#REGEXREF>`__ )."

"In everyday speech or writing, when we \"quote\" a phrase, we set it apart "
