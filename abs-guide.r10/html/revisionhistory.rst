|     Dear HOWTO Coordinator,                                              |
|                                                                          |
|     I am working on and would like to submit to the LDP a HOWTO on the s |
| ubject                                                                   |
|     of "Bash Scripting" (shell scripting, using 'bash'). As it happens,  |
|     I have been writing this document, off and on, for about the last ei |
| ght                                                                      |
|     months or so, and I could produce a first draft in ASCII text format |
|  in                                                                      |
|     a matter of just a few more days.                                    |
|                                                                          |
|     I began writing this out of frustration at being unable to find a    |
|     decent book on shell scripting. I managed to locate some pretty good |
|     articles on various aspects of scripting, but nothing like a complet |
| e,                                                                       |
|     beginning-to-end tutorial.  Well, in keeping with my philosophy, if  |
| all                                                                      |
|     else fails, do it yourself.                                          |
|                                                                          |
|     As it stands, this proposed "Bash-Scripting HOWTO" would serve as a  |
|     combination tutorial and reference, with the heavier emphasis on the |
|     tutorial. It assumes Linux experience, but only a very basic level   |
|     of programming skills. Interspersed with the text are 79 illustrativ |
| e                                                                        |
|     example scripts of varying complexity, all liberally commented. Ther |
| e                                                                        |
|     are even exercises for the reader.                                   |
|                                                                          |
|     At this stage, I'm up to 18,000+ words (124k), and that's over 50 pa |
| ges of                                                                   |
|     text (whew!).                                                        |
|                                                                          |

|     I haven't mentioned that I've previously authored an LDP HOWTO, the  |
|     "Software-Building HOWTO", which I wrote in Linuxdoc/SGML. I don't k |
| now                                                                      |
|     if I could handle Docbook/SGML, and I'm glad you have volunteers to  |
| do                                                                       |
|     the conversion. You people seem to have gotten on a more organized b |
| asis                                                                     |
|     these last few months. Working with Greg Hankins and Tim Bynum was n |

|     but a professional team is even nicer.                               |
