38.3. Where to Go For Help
==========================

`The author <mailto:thegrendel.abs@gmail.com>`_ will infrequently, if
not too busy (and in a good mood), answer general scripting questions.
`[1] <wherehelp.html#FTN.AEN21123>`_ If you have a problem getting a
particular script to work, you would be well advised to post to the
`comp.os.unix.shell <news:comp.unix.shell>`_ Usenet newsgroup.

If you need assistance with a schoolwork assignment, read the pertinent
sections of this and other reference works. Do your best to solve the
problem using your own wits and resources. Please do not waste the
author's time. You will get neither help nor sympathy.
`[2] <wherehelp.html#FTN.AEN21128>`_

Likewise, kindly refrain from annoying the author with solicitations,
offers of employment, or "business opportunities." He is doing just
fine, and requires neither help nor sympathy, thank you.

`[1] <wherehelp.html#AEN21123>`_

E-mails from certain spam-infested TLDs (61, 202, 211, 218, 220, etc.)
will be trapped by spam filters and deleted unread.

Well, if you *absolutely* insist, you can try modifying `Example
A-44 <contributed-scripts.html#HOMEWORK>`_ to suit your purposes.
