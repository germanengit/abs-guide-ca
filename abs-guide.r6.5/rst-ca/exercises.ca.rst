Appendix N. Exercises
=====================

**Table of Contents**

N.1. `Analyzing Scripts <scriptanalysis.html>`_

N.2. `Writing Scripts <writingscripts.html>`_

The exercises that follow test and extend your knowledge of scripting.
Think of them as a challenge, as an entertaining way to take you further
along the stony path toward UNIX wizardry.

On a dingy side street in a run-down section of Hoboken, New Jersey,
 there sits a nondescript squat two-story brick building with an
inscription
 incised on a marble plate in its wall:
 ``Bash Scripting Hall of Fame``.
 Inside, among various dusty uninteresting exhibits is a corroding,
 cobweb-festooned brass plaque inscribed with a short, very short
 list of those few persons who have successfully mastered the material
 in the *Advanced Bash Scripting Guide*, as evidenced by their
performance
 on the following Exercise sections.
 (Alas, the author of the *ABS Guide* is not represented among the
exhibits.
 This is possibly due to malicious rumors about `lack of
credentials <aboutauthor.html#NOCREDS>`_ and
 `deficient scripting skills <contributed-scripts.html#KTOUR0>`_.)
