According to the above table, exit codes 1 - 2, 126 - 165, and 255
`[1] <exitcodes.html#FTN.AEN23629>`__ have special meanings, and should
therefore be avoided for user-specified exit parameters. Ending a script
with *exit 127* would certainly cause confusion when troubleshooting (is
the error code a "command not found" or a user-defined one?). However,
many scripts use an *exit 1* as a general bailout-upon-error. Since exit
code 1 signifies so many possible errors, it is not particularly useful
in debugging.

There has been an attempt to systematize exit status numbers (see
``/usr/include/sysexits.h``), but this is intended for C and C++
programmers. A similar standard for scripting might be appropriate. The
author of this document proposes restricting user-defined exit codes to
the range 64 - 113 (in addition to 0, for success), to conform with the
C/C++ standard. This would allot 50 valid codes, and make
troubleshooting scripts more straightforward.
`[2] <exitcodes.html#FTN.AEN23647>`__ All user-defined exit codes in the
accompanying examples to this document conform to this standard, except
where overriding circumstances exist, as in `Example
9-2 <internalvariables.html#TMDIN>`__.
