If you need assistance with a schoolwork assignment, read the pertinent
sections of this and other reference works. Do your best to solve the
problem using your own wits and resources. *Please do not waste the
author's time.* You will get neither help nor sympathy. ` [1]
 <wherehelp.html#FTN.AEN21329>`__

Likewise, kindly refrain from annoying the author with solicitations,
offers of employment, or "business opportunities." He is doing just
fine, and requires neither help nor sympathy, thank you.

Please note that the author will *not* answer scripting questions for
Sun/Solaris/Oracle or Apple systems. The endarkened execs and the
arachnoid corporate attorneys of those particular outfits have been
using litigation in a predatory manner and/or as a weapon against the
Open Source Community. Any Solaris or Apple users needing scripting help
will therefore kindly direct their concerns to corporate customer
service.
