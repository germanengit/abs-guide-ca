"**Exercise 1.** In ``       /etc/rc.d/init.d      `` , analyze the **halt** "
"script. It is a bit longer than **killall** , but similar in concept. Make a"
" copy of this script somewhere in your home directory and experiment with it"
" (do *not* run it as *root* ). Do a simulated run with the ``       -vn"
"      `` flags ( ``               sh       -vn scriptname             `` ). "
