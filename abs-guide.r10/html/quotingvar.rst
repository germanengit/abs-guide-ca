5.1. Quoting Variables
======================

When referencing a variable, it is generally advisable to enclose its
name in double quotes. This prevents reinterpretation of all special
characters within the quoted string -- except $, \` (backquote), and \\
(escape). `[1] <quotingvar.html#FTN.AEN2630>`__ Keeping $ as a special
character within double quotes permits referencing a quoted variable
(``"$variable"``), that is, replacing the variable with its value (see
`Example 4-1 <varsubn.html#EX9>`__, above).

Use double quotes to prevent word splitting.
`[2] <quotingvar.html#FTN.AEN2688>`__ An argument enclosed in double
quotes presents itself as a single word, even if it contains
`whitespace <special-chars.html#WHITESPACEREF>`__ separators.

| |Tip|                                |
| Enclosing the arguments to an        |
| **echo** statement in double quotes  |
| is necessary only when word          |
| splitting or preservation of         |
| `whitespace <special-chars.html#WHIT |
| ESPACEREF>`__                        |

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Single quotes (' ') operate similarly to double quotes, but do not
permit referencing variables, since the special meaning of $ is turned
off. Within single quotes, *every* special character except ' gets
interpreted literally. Consider single quotes ("full quoting") to be a
stricter method of quoting than double quotes ("partial quoting").

+--------------------------+--------------------------+--------------------------+
| |Note|                   |
| Since even the escape    |
| character (\\) gets a    |
| literal interpretation   |
| within single quotes,    |
| trying to enclose a      |
| single quote within      |
| single quotes will not   |
| yield the expected       |
| result.                  |

`[1] <quotingvar.html#AEN2630>`__

Encapsulating "!" within double quotes gives an error when used *from
the command line*. This is interpreted as a `history
command <histcommands.html>`__. Within a script, though, this problem
does not occur, since the Bash history mechanism is disabled then.

Of more concern is the *apparently* inconsistent behavior of ``\``
within double quotes, and especially following an **echo -e** command.

Double quotes following an *echo* *sometimes* escape ``\``. Moreover,
the ``-e`` option to *echo* causes the "\\t" to be interpreted as a
*tab*.

(Thank you, Wayne Pollock, for pointing this out, and Geoff Lee and
Daniel Barclay for explaining it.)

"Word splitting," in this context, means dividing a character string
into separate and discrete arguments.
