"The ``      /proc     `` directory contains subdirectories with unusual "
"numerical names. Every one of these names maps to the `process ID "
"<internalvariables.html#PPIDREF>`__ of a currently running process. Within "
"each of these subdirectories, there are a number of files that hold useful "
"information about the corresponding process. The ``      stat     `` and ``"
"      status     `` files keep running statistics on the process, the ``"
"      cmdline     `` file holds the command-line arguments the process was "
"invoked with, and the ``      exe     `` file is a symbolic link to the "
"complete path name of the invoking process. There are a few more such files,"
" but these seem to be the most interesting from a scripting standpoint."
