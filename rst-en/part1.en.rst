Part 1. Introduction
====================

*Script: *A writing; a written document. [Obs.]**

*--*Webster's Dictionary*, 1913 ed.*

The shell is a command interpreter. More than just the insulating layer
between the operating system kernel and the user, it's also a fairly
powerful programming language. A shell program, called a *script*, is an
easy-to-use tool for building applications by "gluing together" system
calls, tools, utilities, and compiled binaries. Virtually the entire
repertoire of UNIX commands, utilities, and tools is available for
invocation by a shell script. If that were not enough, internal shell
commands, such as testing and loop constructs, lend additional power and
flexibility to scripts. Shell scripts are especially well suited for
administrative system tasks and other routine repetitive tasks not
requiring the bells and whistles of a full-blown tightly structured
programming language.
